## Description
In this project, we'll overlay a map with an icon that tracks the bus location, working with a mapping library to pull in data asynchronously and display map elements.
## How to run
The web page will show up a map for an specific location. In this case will show up the part of Cambridge around MIT and Harvard Square. Also you will see a button that states "Show Bus Stop Between MIT and Harvard". Once you click over that button the web page will show a map icon that will start to move in equal periods of time over each bus stop you can find between MIT and Harvard. Once the map icon get the last stop the web page stop too.

## Roadmap of future improvements
I want to track buses stops in other locations and see wath other option for tracking are allowed.
